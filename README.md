# 🧠 AI Agent Portfolio

Everyone’s talking about AI.

But most of what’s out there is either hype or half-baked.

This page isn’t about “changing the world with AI.” It’s about solving small, specific, everyday problems that make work feel clunky, repetitive, or slower than it should be.

I’m Akshat. I build AI agents that do one thing well - Make your day a little smoother.

## 👋 About Me

I work across strategy, brand, and growth (currently) in healthcare. At Novo Nordisk, I’ve helped shape global campaigns, build brand plans, and drive adoption for category-defining products (think: GLP-1s).

But behind the decks and dashboards, I love tinkering.

I’ve built agents that power internal tools, automate the boring bits, and help teams get to clarity faster. You’ll find them below :)
